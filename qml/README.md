# QML based Minsweeper
I only wanted to get to know QML and it's relation with C++. So I decided to implement min games from scrtach. Here are some simple
steps I took to implement my game:

* Using QAbstractTableModel for presenting game board on screen(not recomanded solution, why? no full control over game objects)
* Using Some Qml custome types and connecting them toghter by signal and slots

# You need to know
* Qt 5.12.12 Mingw 64bit is used for development
* Not fully implemented
